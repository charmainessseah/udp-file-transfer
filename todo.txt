receive and order packets based on the sequence number (also take into account various sender machines)
struct.pack htonl() for seq_no
recheck that the packet delay/ rate is calculated correctly


Clarifying questions
-------------------------
Can we assume that all packets are received in the order that they are sent?

What is time duration for requester.py? do we start the time when it starts requesting and end the time when all packets are received?
